# CODE VAULT-Code Analyzer
  ![Code Vault](cv_readme.png)

  A **command-line** static code analyser based on **C++** programming language and **terminal operations**. Easy to use and **get insights and anaysis reports** for code files/directories.

## Documentation 📄
  The documentation for this application is available at <**weblink***> 
  
## Features ⚙️⚙️
* Command line interface
* Interactive mode
* Easy install
* Smooth interface
* Data Analysis

## Tech Stack🚀
* **C++**
* Object-oriented programming (**OOP**)
* Data Structures
* File Handling
  
  
## How it works ❓️
1. The application  works on two modes.
2. Mode 1: **Interactive** mode
   Mode 2: **Command-line** mode
3. The application incorporates **O**bject-**O**riented **P**rogramming concepts for file analysis.
4. The files are analyzed based on various file properties.
5.  Suitable Algorithms are used based on the functions of the analyzer.


## Future Upgrades 🛰️
- [ ] New analysis features
- [ ] Improved time complexity
- [ ] User-friendly Commands
- [ ] Improved documentation

## How to run ?🔛
1. Clone the repository :
```bash
<repo clone link>
```
2. Open the folder :
```bash
 cd codevault
```
2) Run with  
    * ### Makefile (*Recommended*)
        1. Open terminal in the **codevault** folder. 
        2. Run ***`mingw32-make`***(for windows) / ***`make`***(for linux/ios).
        3. An executabe file called ***cvault.exe*** / ***cvalut.o*** would be formed.
        4. Run the command     
            * for **Interactive** mode:
              Use ***`cvault.exe`***(windows) or ***`./cvault`***(linux/ios)  in the terminal.
            * for **Command-line** mode:
              Directly type the suitable commands on the terminal interface.

            *(Note: Run ***`mingw32-make clean`*** or ***`make clean`*** to clear object files based on OS)*
        5. The application will open for user interaction.
        ---

    * ### g++(*Manual way / for beginners*)     
        1. Open the terminal in the **codevault** folder.
        2. Run
        ```bash
        g++ main.cp
        ```
        3. An executable file called ***`cvault.exe`*** would be formed.
        4. Run the command ***`cvault.exe`***(windows) or ***`./analyzer`***(linux/ios) in the terminal. (same as Makefile step-4).
        5. The application will execute for user interaction.
